****SPOILER*****

Run the problems using node.js from command line as follows:

```
// install necessary npm modules
npm install
cd problems
// to run a specific problem
node 1.js
// to run all of the problems at once
node run.js
```

These are my solutions to the Project Euler, projecteuler.net, problems in JavaScript! Hopefully you've already tried these out on your own!
