****SPOILER*****

These are my solutions to the Project Euler, projecteuler.net, problems in JavaScript! Hopefully you've already tried these out on your own! Note: Most of these solutions are just first pass solutions, so there are more then likely more optimal solutions.

Run the problems using node.js from the command line as follows:

```
// install necessary npm modules
npm install
cd problems
// to run a specific problem
node 1.js
// to run all of the problems at once
node run.js
```
