================

****SPOILER*****

To run the problems just:

```
// install npm modules
npm install
cd problems
// run whatever problem you want
node 1.js
// or run all of the problems
node run.js
```

These are my solutions to the Project Euler, projecteuler.net, problems in JavaScript! Hopefully you've already tried these out on your own!
